# Roadmap 

This document describes the current roadmap for the project. The roadmap is divided into three main sections: short-term, medium-term, and long-term goals. The roadmap is subject to change and will be updated as the project evolves.

## Short-term goals

The short-term goals are the immediate tasks that need to be completed to reach the next milestone. The short-term goals are:

- Implement the Linear-based Genetic Programming representation.
- Implement the Push-based Genetic Programming representation.
- Implement the Grammar-based Genetic Programming representation.
- Implement the Hyperparameters automatic configuration interface.
- Complete the Logic Synthesis problem domain.
- Finish the documentation of the project.
- Implement the unit tests for the project.
- Run a first set of experiments in different domains.

## Medium-term goals 

The medium-term goals are the tasks that are planned to be completed for the next milestones. The medium-term goals are:

- Curate a set of benchmarks for the project.
- Debug and optimize the current implementations.
- Run a complete experiment in each problem domain.
- Report the results.

## Long-term goals

The long-term goals are the tasks that are planned to be completed for the final milestone. The long-term goals are:

- Expand the project to include more problem domains and other representations.
- Support for additional crossover, mutation, and selection operators agnostic or specific to the representations.
